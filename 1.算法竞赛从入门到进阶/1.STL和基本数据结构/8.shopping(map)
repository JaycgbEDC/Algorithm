Then n lines ,each line contains a string (the length is short than 31 and only contains lowercase letters and capital letters.)stands for the name of the shop.
Then a line contians a number m (1<=m<=50),stands for the days .
Then m parts , every parts contians n lines , each line contians a number s and a string p ,stands for this day ,the shop p 's price has increased s.
 

Output
Contains m lines ,In the ith line print a number of the shop "memory" 's rank after the ith day. We define the rank as :If there are t shops' price is higher than the "memory" , than its rank is t+1.

		cin >> m;
		while (m--) {
			int r = 1;
			for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
				string s2;
				cin >> p >> s2;
				shop[s2] = shop[s2] + p;
			}
			map <string, int>::iterator it;
			for (it = shop.begin(); it != shop.end(); ++it) {
				if (it->second > shop["memory"]) r++;
			}
			cout << r << endl;
		}
